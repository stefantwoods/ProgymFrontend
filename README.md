# Progymnasmata AI Tutor

A web application for practicing the classical **Progymnasmata** rhetorical exercises, with AI-assisted feedback and imitation-based learning.

---

## Purpose

The Progymnasmata were a graded sequence of exercises used in Greek and Roman education to train clarity of thought, moral judgment, and disciplined expression.

This project adapts that curriculum to a modern web interface while preserving its pedagogical intent.

## What the App Does

- Presents Progymnasmata exercises in their traditional order  
- Provides canonical models for imitation  
- Allows users to submit exercises  
- Uses AI to give structured feedback on form, clarity, and faithfulness
